                <br>
                <li><b>It's only fair</b> - women and girls should have the same opportunities

                <li><b>We need their talent</b> - women and girls have valuable skills that are 
                needed by society and employers. Using skills, talent and experiences from a 
                diverse range of people will ultimately deliver better results, whether for society, 
                in the workplace, or for the world as a whole!</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>We need to see it to be it</b> - seeing other girls and women in science is inspiring,
