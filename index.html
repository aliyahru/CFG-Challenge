        <p><b>International Women and Girls in Science Day</b> takes place on <b>11 February</b>.
            It’s an International Day marked by the United Nations (UN), and is an occasion to: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Educate the public about important issues</li><br>
            <li>Mobilise political will and resources</li><br>
            <li>Celebrate humanity’s achievements - in this case women and girls in
                STEM at every level</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

                as this UN video</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>It's only fair</b> - women and girls should have the same opportunities
                as boys and men to pursue STEM education opportunities or a career in science
                and tech</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>We need their talent</b> - women and girls have valuable skills that are
                needed by society and employers. Using skills, talent and experiences from a
                diverse range of people will ultimately deliver better results, whether for society,
                in the workplace, or for the world as a whole!</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>We need to see it to be it</b> - seeing other girls and women in science is inspiring,
                and will encourage girls and women of the future to get stuck into STEM roles.</li>
