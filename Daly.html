</header>

<p> Dr. Daly conducted groundbreaking studies on cholesterol, sugars and proteins. 
    Her early research included studies of the effects of cholesterol on the mechanics of the heart, 
    the effects of sugars and other nutrients of the heart of arteries, and the breakdown of the circulatory system 
    as a result of advanced age or hypertension. Dr. Daly then went on to further study how proteins are produced and organized in the cell.
