<p> ADA 
    
    Ada Lovelace was born Dec 10th in 1815 in England. Educated privately by tutors and then self educated, 
she was helped to advnce in her studies by Augustus De Morgan, teh frist professor of mathematics at the University of London.
   In 1833 she was introduced to Charles Babbage, an English mathematician and inventor who is credited with having conceived 
    the first automatic digital computer, The Engine. Ada, was asked by Babbage to translate and annotate an article written by the Italian 
    mathematician and engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea, her detailed and elaborate annotations were considered to be  excellent; 
    
    “the Analytical Engine, weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves.”
    
    In the end Babbage only built a small part of the Analytical Engine, but Ada had been remembered for her efforts to this day. 
The early programming language Ada was named for her, and the second Tuesday in October has become Ada Lovelace Day, 
    on which the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are honoured.
    
    Today, Ada Lovelace is considered as "The mother of computing"!.

    <p>DALY

        From a young age Daly had always had an interest in science. 
        She was fascinated by Paul De Kruif's popular book  <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/3Zk4wFZ">The Microbe Hunters</a>

        and further inspired by her fathers love of science.
        
        Daly studied at Hunter College High School, an all-female institution, 
        here her her ambition to become a chemist was encouraged. 
        She later enrolled in Queens College and graduated 
        magna cum laude in 1942 with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry.

        After working for a year tutoring chemistry at the Queens College, Daly enrolled in the doctoral program at Columbia
         University. Daly researched how compounds produced in the body affect and participate in digestion under the direction of 
         Mary L. Caldwell, who was known for her work 
         on the important digestive enzyme amylase. Daly's dissertation was “A Study of the Products Formed
           by the Action of Pancreatic Amylase on Corn Starch.” 
           She was awarded her doctoral degree in 1947, 
           only three years after enrolling in the program, 
           and was the first African American woman to 
        obtain a PhD in chemistry in the United States.
        
        Dr. Daly conducted groundbreaking studies on cholesterol, sugars and proteins. 
    Her early research included studies of the effects of cholesterol on the mechanics of the heart, 
    the effects of sugars and other nutrients of the heart of arteries, and the breakdown of the circulatory system 
    as a result of advanced age or hypertension. Dr. Daly then went on to further study how proteins are produced and organized in the cell.

    <p>Jemison


        A Doctorate in Medicine, Chemical Engineer, and NASA Astronaut.

        Mae was introduced to science by her uncle and throughout her childhood developed interests in anthropology, 
        archaeology, evolution, and astronomy. 
        In high school, she became interested in biomedical engineering, and at the age of 16 in 1973 graduated, 
        entering Stanford University. While there she received degrees in chemical engineering and African American studies.

Mae erolled in medical school in 1977, studying at Cordell University, there she persued
an interest in international medicine, she furtehr studied in Kenya in 1979, graduating from medical
school in 1981.

She also became a medical officer with the Peace Corps
 in West Africa. While there she worked in
 conjunction with the National Institutes of Health and 
 the Centers for Disease Control on several research 
projects, including development of a hepatitis B vaccine
 
Upon her return to the USA, she applied to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
to be an Astronaut.

In 1987 she was 1 of 15 accepted out of 2,000 applicants. 
Jemison completed her
 training as a mission specialist with NASA in 1988.

    On 12 September,1992, Dr. Jemison was the first 
    African American woman to travel in space aboard the
     Endeavor. She was inspired 
    to become an astronaut because of Star Trek and
     later appeared on Star Trek: The Next
      Generation where Dr. Jemison played Lieutenant Palmer.
    
    “I was excited about the world around me… You know, when you talk about science, it's very hard for me to tell you as a child, what drew me to it. 
    But I think now as an adult looking back, it was the creativity that drew me to it. The possibilities. 
    Understanding what was going on in the world around me.”

    <p> Marie
Marie Curie was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867. he received a general education in local schools and some 
scientific training from her father.In 1891, she went to 
Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she 
obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. Here she met Pierre Curie whom she married in in 1894, he was a 
Professor in the School of Physics. She succeeded her husband as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, 
and gained her Doctor of Science degree in 1903.

Marie Curie actively promoted the use of radium to alleviate suffering and during World War I, 
assisted by her daughter, Irene, she personally devoted herself to this.

Her work is recorded in numerous papers in scientific journals and she is the author of Recherches sur les Substances Radioactives (1904), 
and, L’Isotopie et les Éléments Isotopes and the classic Traité’ de Radioactivité (1910).

<P>HILL

        Mary Elliott Hill was born in 1907 and is one of the first African American women to be awarded 
        with a masters degree in chemistry. She attended Virginia State College in 1925, gaining her dgree
        in 1929.

        In 1939 she began teaching at Virgina State Unversity's Laboratory Hugh School.

        Mary Hill instituted student chapters of the American Chemical Society at some of the historically black colleges 
        and universities where she taught. It is estimated that at least 20 of her students 
        went on to become chemistry professors, 
        and she won awards for her teaching.[9][10] She was also a member of the Tennessee Academy of 
        Science and the National Institute of Science.
        
        She was an organic and analytic chemist. Her work specified in ultraviolet light and 
        using that to develop analytic methodology. 
    In collaboration with her husband Carl McClellan Hill developed ketene synthesis which was 
    instrumental in the development of plastics.
