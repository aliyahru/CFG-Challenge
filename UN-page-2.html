      <h3>MARY ANNING</h3>
      <h4>1799-1847</h4>
      <p>Mary Anning was born in Lyme Regis, a popular seaside resort in England. Her father was a carpenter and the family was very poor. They
        supplemented their income by finding fossils in nearby cliffs and selling these to tourists. This is how Mary first developed an interest
        in fossil hunting. Her formal education was very limited although she learned to read and write through her Sunday School.</p>
      
      <p>As an adult Mary continued to collect and sell fossils, but struggled financially for most of her life. Collecting fossils was hard
        and dangerous work, and she had a near miss with a landslide in 1833 resulting in the death of her dog. In 1823 she found the first complete
        Plesiosaurus, and in 1828 the first British example of pterosaurs (then called a 'flying dragon' when displayed at the British Museum). She was
        meticulous in identifying, labelling and classifying her finds.</p>
        
       <p>As a woman she was not able to join the Geological Society of London, and did not always
         receive credit for her scientific contributions. The only scientific piece of writing that was published in her lifetime was a letter
         that she wrote to the Magazine of Natural History's editor in 1839. However her discoveries were extremely important, contributing to changes 
         in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the earth.</p>

      <h3>MARIE CURIE</h3>
      <h4>1867 - 1934</h4>                                                                                                                                    
    <p>Marie Curie was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867, to a family of teachers who believed strongly in education. She received a general education 
      in local schools and some scientific training from her father. In 1891, she went to Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she 
      obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences.</p>
      <p>While in Paris she met Pierre Curie, a Professor in the School of Physics, who she married in 1894. Together they discovered radium and 
        polonium. Pierre Curie initially rejected the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics, only accepting it eventually on the condition that his wife's contribution
        was also recognised. This made Marie the first-ever female Nobel Laureate. She succeeded her husband as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, and gained her Doctor of Science degree in 
      1903.</p>                                                                                                                                    
     <p>Marie Curie actively promoted the use of radium to alleviate suffering. During World War I, assisted by her daughter, Irene, she 
       personally devoted herself to this. Her work is recorded in numerous papers in scientific journals and she is the author of 'Recherches 
       sur les Substances Radioactives' (1904), L’Isotopie et les Éléments Isotopes' and the classic 'Traité de Radioactivité' (1910).</p>

      <h3>MARY ELLIOTT HILL</h3>
      <h4>1907 - 1969</h4>
      <p>Mary Elliott Hill was born in 1907 and is one of the first African American women to be awarded 
        with a masters degree in chemistry. She attended Virginia State College in 1925, gaining her degree
        in 1929. In 1939 she began teaching at Virgina State Unversity's Laboratory Hugh School.</p>
       <p>Mary Elliott Hill was an organic and analytic chemist. Her work  specified in ultraviolet light and using that to develop analytic methodology. 
        In collaboration with her husband Carl McClellan Hill developed ketene synthesis which was instrumental in the development of plastics.  
        <p>Mary instituted student chapters of the American Chemical Society at some of the historically black colleges 
        and universities where she taught. It is estimated that at least 20 of her students went on to become chemistry professors, 
        and she won awards for her teaching, demonstrating the power of her influence through education as well as through her immediate
          contributions to science.</p>

      <h3>MARIE MAYNARD DALY</h3>
      <h4>1921 - 2003</h4>
      <p>Dr. Daly was an American biochemist, and the first African-American woman in the United States to receive a PhD in chemistry.</p>
      <p>From a young age Marie always had an interest in science. She was fascinated by Paul De Kruif's popular book  
        <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/3Zk4wFZ">The Microbe Hunters</a> and was inspired by her father's love of science. She studied at
        Hunter College High School, an all-female institution, where her ambition to become a chemist was encouraged. She enrolled in Queens
        College and graduated magna cum laude in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. She received her doctoral agree in 1947 from
        Columbia university, only three years after enrolling in the program.</p>
      <p> In her career she conducted groundbreaking studies on cholesterol, sugars and proteins. 
        Her early research included studies of the effects of cholesterol on the mechanics of the heart, 
        the effects of sugars and other nutrients of the heart of arteries, and the breakdown of the circulatory system 
        as a result of advanced age or hypertension. Dr. Daly went on to study how proteins are produced and organised in the cell.</p>

      <h3>KATHERINE G. JOHNSON</h3>
      <h4>1918 - 2020</h4>
      <p>Katherine Johnson was an amazing American mathemetician whose calculations of orbital mathematics 
        as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S crewed spaceflights.</p>
    
       <p>Katherine was born in 1918. Although she had strong mathematical abilities, the County she lived in did not offer
         public schooling for African-Amercian students beyond 8th grade. Her parents invested
        in her education by arranging for her to attend school in West Virginia and at just 15, Katherine enrolled in 
         West Virginia State University. In 1937 Katherine graduated with the highest possible honors and then focused on teaching mathematics and
         West Virginia State's graduate programme, where she was the first ever African American woman in this program.</p>
        
        <p>Katherine began her career as a mathematician at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1953. She worked with other women, 
          constantly performing calculations and reading data. Her calculations were critical to the success of the first and subsequent US crewed
          space flights. She was known as a 'human computer' because of her extraordinary mathematical capability and ability to work with space trajectories.</p>
        
      <p>In 2016 a film "Hidden Figures" was released focused on her and her colleagues (two other amazing women):
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson_(engineer)">Mary Jackson </a> and
        <a href=" https://www.nasa.gov/content/dorothy-vaughan-biography">Dorothy Vaugn</a>. She was also awarded the Presidential Medal
      of Freedom by then President of the US Barack Obama.</p>

      <h3>MAE C. JEMISON</h3>
      <h4>1956 -</h4>
      <p>Mae C. Jemison has a Doctorate in Medicine, is a Chemical Engineer, and was a NASA Astronaut.</p>
        
       <p>Mae was introduced to science by her uncle and throughout her childhood developed interests in anthropology, 
        archaeology, evolution, and astronomy. In high school, she became interested in biomedical engineering and graduated at the age of 16.
         She studied a wide range of subjects in lots of different locations, from chemical engineering and African American studies, to international
         medicine in both the US and Kenya. She graduated from medical school in 1981.</p>
      <p>She also became a medical officer with the Peace Corps in West Africa. While there she worked in conjunction with the National 
        Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control on several research projects, including development of a hepatitis B vaccine.</p>
 
<p>Upon her return to the USA, she applied to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
to be an Astronaut. In 1987 she was one of 15 accepted out of 2,000 applicants. Jemison completed her training as a mission specialist with NASA in 1988.
On 12 September,1992, Dr. Jemison was the first African American woman to travel in space aboard the Endeavour. She was inspired to become an astronaut 
  because of Star Trek and later appeared on Star Trek: The Next Generation where Dr. Jemison played Lieutenant Palmer.</p>
    
    <p>“I was excited about the world around me… You know, when you talk about science, it's very hard for me to tell you as a child, what drew me to it. 
    But I think now as an adult looking back, it was the creativity that drew me to it. The possibilities. 
      Understanding what was going on in the world around me.”</p>

  <h3>Marie Curie</h3>
  <p>Marie Salomea Skłodowska–Curie (/ˈkjʊəri/ KURE-ee,[4] French pronunciation: ​[maʁi kyʁi], Polish pronunciation: [ˈmarja skwɔˈdɔfska kʲiˈri]; born Maria Salomea Skłodowska, Polish: [ˈmarja salɔˈmɛa skwɔˈdɔfska]; 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the only woman to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.[5]

<p>She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work developing the theory of "radioactivity"—a term she coined.[6][7] In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes.</p>

<p>Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institute in Paris in 1920, and the Curie Institute in Warsaw in 1932; both remain major medical research centres. During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.</p></p>
