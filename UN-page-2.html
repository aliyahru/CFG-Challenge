      <h3>MARIE MAYNARD DALY</h3>
      <p>Dr. Daly conducted groundbreaking studies on cholesterol, sugars and proteins. 
        Her early research included studies of the effects of cholesterol on the mechanics of the heart, 
        the effects of sugars and other nutrients of the heart of arteries, and the breakdown of the circulatory system 
        as a result of advanced age or hypertension. Dr. Daly then went on to further study how proteins are produced and organized in the cell.</p>

      <h3>MAE C. JEMISON</h3>
      <p>A Doctorate in Medicine, Chemical Engineer, and NASA Astronaut.

        On 12 September,1992, Dr. Jemison was the first African American woman to travel in space aboard the Endeavor. She was inspired 
        to become an astronaut because of Star Trek and later appeared on Star Trek: The Next Generation where Dr. Jemison played Lieutenant Palmer.
        
        “I was excited about the world around me… You know, when you talk about science, it's very hard for me to tell you as a child, what drew me to it. 
        But I think now as an adult looking back, it was the creativity that drew me to it. The possibilities. 
        Understanding what was going on in the world around me.”

      <h3>KATHERINE G. JOHNSON</h3>
      <p>Katherine Johnson was an amazing American mathemetician whose calculations of orbital mathematics 
        as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S crewed spaceflights.
    
        Katherine was born in 1918 and died January 24th 2020. Although she had strong mathematical abilities, 
    she struggled with education being a woman and an African American, her parents invested
        in her education by arranging for her to attend school in Institute, West Virginia. 
    
    SKatherine's 
        African American heritage and her gender only meant that a mathematical career would be difficult.
        HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT HOLD HER BACK!!
        
        At just 15, Katherine enrolled in a historically Black college, West Virginia State.
        
        In 1937 Katherine graduated with the highest possible honors and then focused on teaching mathematics.
        In 1939 graduate schools began intergrating pupils, at this point it meant Katherine could enrol in West Virginia State's graduate programme.
        
        Katherine Johnson was one of only three students offered a place at this university, this made a huge impact
    she enrolled in the graduate maths programme as an African American woman, she was the first African American woman to ever go to graduate school at
        West Virginia State. After one year, she quit the programme to marry and start a family with her husband.
    
    In 1952, Katherine applied as a mathematician at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and soon began her career 
        as a mathematician in 1953. She worked with other women, constantly performing calculations and reading data.
        
      In 2016 a film "Hidden Figures" was released focused on her and her colleagues (Another two amazing women)
