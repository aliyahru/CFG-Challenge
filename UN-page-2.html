      <h3>MARIE CURIE</h3>
      <h4>1867 - 1934</h4>                                                                                                                                    
    <p>Marie Curie was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867, to a family of teachers who believed strongly in education. She received a general education 
      in local schools and some scientific training from her father. In 1891, she went to Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she 
      obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. Here she met Pierre Curie, a Professor in the School of Physics, 
      who she married in 1894. She succeeded her husband as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, and gained her Doctor of Science degree in 
      1903.</p>                                                                                                                                    
     <p>Marie Curie actively promoted the use of radium to alleviate suffering. During World War I, assisted by her daughter, Irene, she 
       personally devoted herself to this. Her work is recorded in numerous papers in scientific journals and she is the author of 'Recherches 
       sur les Substances Radioactives' (1904), L’Isotopie et les Éléments Isotopes' and the classic 'Traité de Radioactivité' (1910).</p>

      <h3>MARY ELLIOTT HILL</h3>
      <h4>1907 - 1969</h4>
      <p>Mary Elliott Hill was born in 1907 and is one of the first African American women to be awarded 
        with a masters degree in chemistry. She attended Virginia State College in 1925, gaining her degree
        in 1929. In 1939 she began teaching at Virgina State Unversity's Laboratory Hugh School.</p>
       <p>Mary Elliott Hill was an organic and analytic chemist. Her work  specified in ultraviolet light and using that to develop analytic methodology. 
        In collaboration with her husband Carl McClellan Hill developed ketene synthesis which was instrumental in the development of plastics.  
        <p>Mary instituted student chapters of the American Chemical Society at some of the historically black colleges 
        and universities where she taught. It is estimated that at least 20 of her students went on to become chemistry professors, 
        and she won awards for her teaching, demonstrating the power of her influence through education as well as through her immediate
          contributions to science.</p>

      <h3>MARIE MAYNARD DALY</h3>
      <h4>1921 - 2003</h4>
      <p>Dr. Daly was an American biochemist, and the first African-American woman in the United States to receive a PhD in chemistry.</p>
      <p>From a young age Daly had always had an interest in science. She was fascinated by Paul De Kruif's popular book  
        <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/3Zk4wFZ">The Microbe Hunters</a> and further inspired by her father's love of science. She studied at
        Hunter College High School, an all-female institution, where her ambition to become a chemist was encouraged. She later enrolled in Queens
        College and graduated magna cum laude in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. She was awared her doctoral agree in 1947 from
        Columbia university, only three years after enrolling in the program.</p>
      <p> In her career she conducted groundbreaking studies on cholesterol, sugars and proteins. 
        Her early research included studies of the effects of cholesterol on the mechanics of the heart, 
        the effects of sugars and other nutrients of the heart of arteries, and the breakdown of the circulatory system 
        as a result of advanced age or hypertension. Dr. Daly then went on to study how proteins are produced and organised in the cell.</p>

      <h3>KATHERINE G. JOHNSON</h3>
      <h4>1918 - 2020</h4>
      <p>Katherine Johnson was an amazing American mathemetician whose calculations of orbital mathematics 
        as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S crewed spaceflights.</p>
    
       <p>Katherine was born in 1918. Although she had strong mathematical abilities, the County she lived in did not offer
         public schooling for African-Amercian students beyond 8th grade. Her parents invested
        in her education by arranging for her to attend school in Institute, West Virginia and at just 15, Katherine enrolled in 
         West Virginia State University. In 1937 Katherine graduated with the highest possible honors and then focused on teaching mathematics and
         West Virginia State's graduate programme, where she was the first ever African American woman in this program.</p>
        
        <p>In 1952, Katherine applied as a mathematician at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and soon began her career 
        as a mathematician in 1953. She worked with other women, constantly performing calculations and reading data. She worked on
          calculating trajectories, launch windows and emergency return paths for Project Mercury spaceflights, and rendezvous paths for the
          Apollo Lunar Module and command module on flights to the moon. She was known as a
          'human computer' because of her extraordinary mathematical capability and ability to work with space trajectories. Given the technology
          available at the time, her work is particularly extraordinary.</p>
        
      <p>In 2016 a film "Hidden Figures" was released focused on her and her colleagues (two other amazing women):
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson_(engineer)">Mary Jackson </a> and
        <a href=" https://www.nasa.gov/content/dorothy-vaughan-biography">Dorothy Vaugn</a></p>

      <h3>MAE C. JEMISON</h3>
      <h4>1956 -</h4>
      <p>Mae C. Jemison has a Doctorate in Medicine, is a Chemical Engineer, and was a NASA Astronaut.</p>
        
       <p>Mae was introduced to science by her uncle and throughout her childhood developed interests in anthropology, 
        archaeology, evolution, and astronomy. In high school, she became interested in biomedical engineering, and at the 
         age of 16 in 1973 graduated, entering Stanford University. While there she received degrees in chemical engineering 
         and African American studies. Mae erolled in medical school in 1977, studying at Cordell University, where she pursued
an interest in international medicine. She further studied in Kenya in 1979, graduating from medical school in 1981.</p>
      <p>She also became a medical officer with the Peace Corps in West Africa. While there she worked in conjunction with the National 
        Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control on several research projects, including development of a hepatitis B vaccine.</p>
 
<p>Upon her return to the USA, she applied to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
to be an Astronaut. In 1987 she was one of 15 accepted out of 2,000 applicants. Jemison completed her training as a mission specialist with NASA in 1988.
On 12 September,1992, Dr. Jemison was the first African American woman to travel in space aboard the Endeavour. She was inspired to become an astronaut 
  because of Star Trek and later appeared on Star Trek: The Next Generation where Dr. Jemison played Lieutenant Palmer.</p>
    
    <p>“I was excited about the world around me… You know, when you talk about science, it's very hard for me to tell you as a child, what drew me to it. 
    But I think now as an adult looking back, it was the creativity that drew me to it. The possibilities. 
      Understanding what was going on in the world around me.”</p>
