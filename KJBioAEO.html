<h2><u>BIOGRAPHY</u></h2> 
</header>

<p> Katherine Johnson was an amazing American mathemetician whose calculations of orbital mathematics 
    as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S crewed spaceflights.

    Katherine was born in 1918 and died January 24th 2020. Although she had strong mathematical abilities, 
she struggled with education being a woman and an African American, her parents invested
    in her education by arranging for her to attend school in Institute, West Virginia. 

SKatherine's 
    African American heritage and her gender only meant that a mathematical career would be difficult.
    HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT HOLD HER BACK!!
    
    At just 15, Katherine enrolled in a historically Black college, West Virginia State.
    
    In 1937 Katherine graduated with the highest possible honors and then focused on teaching mathematics.
    In 1939 graduate schools began intergrating pupils, at this point it meant Katherine could enrol in West Virginia State's graduate programme.
    
    Katherine Johnson was one of only three students offered a place at this university, this made a huge impact
she enrolled in the graduate maths programme as an African American woman, she was the first African American woman to ever go to graduate school at
    West Virginia State. After one year, she quit the programme to marry and start a family with her husband.

In 1952, Katherine applied as a mathematician at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and soon began her career 
    as a mathematician in 1953. She worked with other women, constantly performing calculations and reading data.
    
  In 2016 a film "Hidden Figures" was released focused on her and her colleagues (Another two amazing women)

    For rest of her career, Katherine Johnson worked as a ‘computer’, specifically looking at topics
    relating to aircraft.She continued to help with expeditions
    and communications, She worked on the Apollo’s Lunar Module, 
    the Space Shuttle and the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (Landsat), and so much more, including over 25 research reports.
    

    In 2015 she was awareded with the Presidential medal of Freedom for a liftime 
    of work as a mathematician and space scientist and pioneering physicist.
